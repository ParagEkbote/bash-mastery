This project is being refactored and can be considered as W.I.P.

## Intro

The main motivation of this script is to reduce the bugs experienced when using huggingface libraries such as transformers and trl.

The install_libraries.sh contains the script needed for a ml project using huggingface.

Note: The following libraries will get installed directly from their build source:

torch,numpy,transformers,datasets,accelerate,peft,trl,huggingface_hub,bitsandbytes,matplotlib and scipy.

## Steps

Execute the script by writing the following commands in your terminal:

1) chmod +x install_libraries.sh

2) ./install_libraries.sh

## Future:

Several useful scripts related to OS operations will be added to ease developer experience.
